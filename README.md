This is a practical example of how to decompile a Fabric mod into usable code, by hand. See scripts for details. 

### in

The input of tiny-remapper as set in example bash script.

### out

The output of programs (see Bash script).

### bin

I was too lazy to include a toolchain to compile/download the latest fernflower & tinyremapper,
so here's some precompiled jar from code pulled from the git repos. If you don't trust me you can replace them or whatever.

### mappings

The dir containing the .tiny file used by tiny-remapper to make the remapped jar.

### LICENSE-allure.txt

The license Allure was posted under on CurseForge, thus enabling me to do this whole thing.

Why didn't you just release the source, steve? You could have just released the source. I asked nicely. AND YOU DIDN'T.
